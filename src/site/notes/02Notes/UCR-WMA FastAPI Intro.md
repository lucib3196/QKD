FastAPI is a web framework which helps you build [[02Notes/UCR-MWA REST API Design Principles\|RESTful]] web applications. 

FastAPI has these main advantages

1. **Performance**: In some cases as fast as Node.js and Go (unusual for python frameworks)
2. **Faster Development**
3. **Better code Quality**: Via type hinting and models
4. **Autogenerated documentation**

## Installing

```python
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

## A simple FastAPI endpoint

Create a file `main.py` with:

```python
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/hi")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

### Structure of an Endpoint

- The `app` is a top level FastAPI object which represents our entire application
- `app.get()`: Is a **path decorator**, which indicates the URL "hi" the server should be directed to the function`read_root()`
- The function `def read_root()` is a **path function**
## Running 

There are two main ways to run the fast api application either through FastAPI cli commands or uvicorn

**Running with FastAPI CLI**

```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```

**Running with Uvicorn**

**Note requires installing uvicorn**
```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**Note**: The flag `--reload` indicates that when we make changes to our code it will auto run again, good for development.
