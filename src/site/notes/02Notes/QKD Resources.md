# Computer Vision 
## Camera

- [[02Notes/Camera Calibration\|Camera Calibration]]: A note covering why camera calibration is a thing
- [[02Notes/How Camera Calibration was used for the senior design project\|How Camera Calibration was used for the senior design project]]: A bit more technical contains a note that for PiCamera calibration you need to specify the resolution of the current camera settings
-  [[02Notes/Multithreading in Python and OpenCV for better performance\|Multithreading in Python and OpenCV for better performance]]: This method was used for the base qkd project to increase frame rate, it has an official source on how to implement **see this !!!!**
## Aruco Markers

- [[02Notes/ArUco Markers\|Aruco Marker Basics]]: Covers what an ARuco Marker is. Additionally this note contains resources on how to perform ARuco detection
- [[02Notes/Pose Estimation using ArUco Marker for Senior Design\|Pose Estimation using ArUco Marker for Senior Design]]: This note covers the basic idea of how Aruco markers where used for the senior design
