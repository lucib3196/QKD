##  Backend Architecture Understanding Layers 

Here students learn how to break down an application into separate layers

- [[Layered Backend Architecture (Data / Service / Web)\|Layered Backend Architecture (Data / Service / Web)]]
  - [[Data Layer (Models & ORM)\|Data Layer (Models & ORM)]]
  - [[Service Layer (Business Logic)\|Service Layer (Business Logic)]]
  - [[Web Layer (Routes & Schemas)\|Web Layer (Routes & Schemas)]]

## Databases 

Students go from “what is SQL?” to fully integrated models + migrations.

- [[Database Overview (SQL vs NoSQL)\|Database Overview (SQL vs NoSQL)]]
- [[Introduction to SQLModel\|Introduction to SQLModel]]
- [[Database Migrations with Alembic\|Database Migrations with Alembic]]
- [[Database Comparison (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Mongo)\|Database Comparison (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Mongo)]]

## Cloud Integration (Firebase)

Add real-world capabilities like cloud file storage + third-party auth.

- [[What is Cloud Storage\|What is Cloud Storage]]
- [[What Is Firebase\|What Is Firebase]]
- [[Using Firebase Storage with FastAPI\|Using Firebase Storage with FastAPI]]
- [[Firebase Authentication with Python SDK\|Firebase Authentication with Python SDK]]

## First Refactor

A professional-quality codebase requires configuration, settings, and logs.
